## Architecture

SFU Connect is built with a microservice architecture and is deployed using serverless GCP technologies.

The system is designed to be secure, performant, scalable, and available.

## Note

Since the deployment of this project relies on GCP credits, a working deployment link is unfortunately unavailable. 

The local setup for this project is also quite inconvenient to get running, and tbh, nobody is likely reading this README anyways.

A working demo has been left as an exercise to the reader.
